With Julian and David
- Dots on the map were too small and hard to click on
- Clicking on a dot next to a country displays both popups
- Naturally discovered how to click on a cluster to zoom in
- Figured out how to scroll on the map to zoom
- Figured out how to toggle between different regions in the chart
- Clicked on the logo to return to the home page
- They didn't notice the difference between the home page explore button and the header explore button
- Didn't know how to accelerate in the pirate game
