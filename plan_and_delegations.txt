We will have a main page that briefly explains what the website is about, and a button saying "explore".
That takes you to a page with a prominent map. The map has a bunch of dots (possibly a heatmap later),
corresponding to each pirate attack. If we decide to add extra display options later, they will be on
a menu above the map, which switch views on the same map.

TASKS:
1. Creating the map. Using a Java Script library to display a map and be able to zoom and pan it.
