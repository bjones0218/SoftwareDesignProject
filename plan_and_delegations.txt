We will have a main page that briefly explains what the website is about, and a button saying "explore".
That takes you to a page with a prominent map. The map has a bunch of dots (possibly a heatmap later),
corresponding to each pirate attack. If we decide to add extra display options later, they will be on
a menu above the map, which switch views on the same map.

TASKS:
1. Creating the map. Using a Java Script library to display a map and be able to zoom and pan it.
Blake, Leon
2. Creating the UI for the home page and the map page. It must have a space where the map can be inserted.
Cameron, Leon
3. Adding dots to the map, making the dots clickable to display extra information, automatically adding the dots to the map using the database.
Blake, Henry
4. Reach task: create supplemental information like bar plots, country indicators, etc.
Johnathan
5. Adding country data to the map. Making it so that you can click the countries to display indicators about them.
Henry
